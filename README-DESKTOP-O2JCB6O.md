# Windows UI Library (WinUI) Specs

This repository contains archived and in-progress spec documents for APIs in the Windows UI Library (WinUI):  
https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml

Documents in this repo are used as part of Microsoft's WinUI spec review process for features in development and are not intended to be up-to-date developer documentation.

For up-to-date developer documentation on WinUI and related APIs please see:  
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp

For product issues, bugs, and feature requests please use the main WinUI repo:

## Contributing

This repo is maintained by the Microsoft WinUI team.

### Please DO:

* provide feedback on **active pull requests**, which represent new features that are being reviewed
* provide feedback on spec documents in the ```active``` folder, which represent new features that are being worked on for a future release

### Please DO NOT:

* provide feedback on spec documents in the ```archive``` folder since those features have already been released. Please contribute feedback or suggested changes to [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp) instead.
* send us unsolicited PRs that add new specs. To propose a new feature, please follow the WinUI contribution process [described here](https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/feature_proposal_process.md) which starts with opening an issue in the WinUI repo:  
https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml
* rely on this repo for final developer documentation. Please see [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp).

### Spec workflow

For WinUI team members, the workflow to author specs is:

1. Ensure your proposal is approved and in plan.

2. Create a new working branch: ```/user/<username>/<feature>```

3. Create a new folder for your spec under the ```active``` folder: ```/active/<feature>```

4. Author your spec using the [spec template](/spec_template.md).  
Please use relative links for images or other assets in the folder.

5. When your spec is ready for review:
   * Open a new pull request to merge your spec to the ```master``` branch
   * Update your proposal issue with a link to the spec PR

6. Review spec in checkpoint meetings to close open issues.

7. When your spec is complete and signed off, merge the PR.

8. Use your completed spec as the basis for [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs) articles and [Controls Gallery](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) samples.

9. Once the feature is documented:
   * Close the proposal issue
   * Add the following header to your spec:
     > This spec is archived and may not be up to date.  
For up-to-date developer documentation please see: ```<insert link>```
   * Move your spec from ```/active``` to ```/archive/<release>```
