# Number box

## Background
Xaml has a TextBox control for text input, which can be used for numeric input, but numeric input scenarios benefit from custom features, such as buttons to increment/decrement. The NumberBox control in this spec provides these features. This will ship as part of the [WinUI package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml), not as part of the Windows OS.

## Description
Represents a control that can be used to display and edit numbers. This supports validation, increment stepping, and computing inline calculations of basic equations, such as multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.

## Is this the right control? 

You can use a NumberBox control to capture and display mathematic input. If you need an editable text box that accepts more than numbers, use the [TextBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.TextBox) control. If you need an editable text box that accepts passwords or other sensitive input, see [PasswordBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.passwordbox). If you need a text box to enter search terms, see [AutoSuggestBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox). If you need to enter or edit formatted text, see [RichEditBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.richeditbox).

## Examples

### Create a simple NumberBox

Here's the XAML for a basic NumberBox that demonstrates the default look. Use [x:Bind](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/x-bind-markup-extension#property-path) to ensure the data displayed to the user remains in sync with the data stored in your app. 


```XAML
<NumberBox Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}" />
```

### Labeling NumberBox

Use `Header` or `PlaceholderText` if the purpose of the NumberBox isn't clear. `Header` is visible whether or not the NumberBox has a value. 

```XAML
<NumberBox Header="Enter expression:"
    Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}" />
```

![A header reading "Enter expression:" above a NumberBox.](images/numberbox-header.PNG)

`PlaceholderText` is displayed inside the NumberBox and disappears once a value has been entered.

```XAML
<NumberBox PlaceholderText="A + B"
    Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}" />
```

![A NumberBox containing placeholder text reading "A + B".](images/numberbox-placeholder-text.PNG)

### Enable calculation support

Setting the `AcceptsCalculation` property to true enables NumberBox to evaluate basic inline expressions such as multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction using standard order of operations. Evaluation is triggered on loss of focus or when the user presses the "Enter" key. Once an expression is evaluated, the original form of the expression is not preserved.

XAML
```XAML
<NumberBox Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}"
    AcceptsCalculation="True" />
```

### Add increment and decrement stepping

Use the `SpinButtonPlacementMode` property to enable buttons in the NumberBox control that can be clicked to increment or decrement the value in the NumberBox. These buttons will be disabled if a Maximum or Minimum value would be surpassed with another step. The amount of increment/decrement is specified with the `StepFrequency` property, which defaults to 1.

This defaults to `Hidden`, but NumberBox offers two visible placement modes: `Inline` and `Compact`. Set `SpinButtonPlacementMode` to `Inline` to enable the buttons to appear beside the control. 

XAML
```XAML
<NumberBox Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}"
    StepFrequency="2"
    SpinButtonPlacementMode="Inline" />
```

![A NumberBox with a down-arrow button and up-arrow button beside it.](images/numberbox-spinbutton-inline.PNG)

Set `SpinButtonPlacementMode` to `Compact` to enable the buttons to appear as a Flyout only when the NumberBox is in focus.  

XAML
```XAML
<NumberBox Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}"
    StepFrequency="2"
    SpinButtonPlacementMode="Compact" />
```

![A NumberBox with a small icon inside of it showing an arrow pointing up and an arrow pointing down.](images/numberbox-spinbutton-compact-non-visible.PNG)

![A NumberBox with a down-arrow button and up-arrow button floating off to the side at an elevated layer.](images/numberbox-spinbutton-compact-visible.PNG)

### Enabling input validation

Setting `ValidationMode` to `InvalidInputOverwritten` will enable NumberBox to overwrite invalid input that is not numerical nor legally formulaic with the last valid value when evaluation is triggered on loss of focus or a press of the "Enter" key.

XAML
```XAML
<NumberBox Header="Quantity"
    Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}"
    ValidationMode="InvalidInputOverwritten" />
```

Setting `ValidationMode` to `Disabled` allows custom input validation to be configured.  

### Formatting input 

[Number formatting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.globalization.numberformatting) can be used to format the value of a Numberbox by configuring an instance of a formatting class and assigning it to the `NumberFormatter` property. Decimal, currency, percent, and significant figures are few of the number formatting classes available. 

Here is an example of using DecimalFormatter to format a NumberBox's value to have one integer digit and two fraction digits:  

XAML
```XAML
<NumberBox  x:Name="FormattedNumberBox"
Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}" />
```

C#
```C#
private void SetNumberBoxNumberFormatter()
{
    DecimalFormatter formatter = new DecimalFormatter();
    formatter.IntegerDigits = 1;
    formatter.FractionDigits = 2;
    FormattedNumberBox.NumberFormatter = formatter;
}
```

![A NumberBox showign a value of 0.00.](images/numberbox-formatted.PNG)

### Enabling hyper scroll 

Setting `IsHyperScrollEnabled` to true enables the value of NumberBox to be incremented or decremented by scrolling when a NumberBox has focus and is being hovered over. 

XAML
```XAML
<NumberBox Value="{x:Bind Path=ViewModel.NumberBoxValue, Mode=TwoWay}"
    IsHyperScrollEnabled="True" />
```

## Remarks

### Input Scope

`Number` will be used for the [input scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.InputScopeNameValue). This input scope is intended for working with digits 0-9. This may be overwritten but alternative InputScope types will not be explicitly supported. 

### Not a Number

When a NumberBox is cleared of input, `Value` will be set to `NaN` to indicate no numerical value is present. 

## Recommendations

* `Text` and `Value` make it easy to capture the value of a NumberBox as a String or as a Double without needing to convert the value bewteen types. When programmatically altering the value of a NumberBox, it is recommended to do so through the `Value` property. `Value` will overwrite `Text` in initial set up. After the initial set up, changes to one will be progrogated to the other, but consistently making programmatic changes through `Value` helps avoid any conceptual misunderstanding that NumberBox will accept non-numeric characters through `Text`.

## Appendix

### Behavioral Components

| Property | Notes |
|:---:|:---|
| InputScope | "Number" will be used for the InputScope. This may be overwritten by the developer but alternative InputScope types will not be explicitly supported. | 
| AcceptsCalculation | NumberBox will provide computation support for multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction across parenthetical order with standard operator precedence; i.e., [ 0-9()+-/* ] |
| Validation | * If ValidationMode="Disabled", no automatic validation will occur. This setting allows developers to configure custom validation via [Input Validation]( https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/blob/user/lucashaines/inputvalidation/active/InputValidation/InputValidation.md). <br><br> * If ValidationMode="InvalidInputOverwritten", input that is non-numerical/formulaic will automatically be overwritten with the last legal value. |
| Events | * Loss of focus, "Enter", and stepping [SEE API NOTES > SPINBUTTON && HYPER SCROLL && HYPER DRAG && KEYBOARD STEPPING] will trigger evalution. <br><br> * When Text (derived from TextBox) is changed by codebehind or user input on the evaluation triggers noted above, the TextChanging event will be fired. After, if ValidationEnabled="True", validation will be performed [See API NOTES > VALIDATION]. Text will then be updated and the TextChanged event will be fired. Text will then be converted to a Double and the ValueChanging event event will be fired. After, Value will be updated and the ValueChanged event will be fired. <br><br> * When Value is changed by codebehind, the ValueChanging event will be fired. After, if ValidationEnabled="True", validation will be performed [See API NOTES > VALIDATION]. Value will then be updated and the ValueChanged event will be fired. Value will then be converted to a String and the TextChanging event event will be fired.  After, Text will be updated and the TextChanged event will be fired. |
| SpinButton | * When SpinButtonPlacementMode="Compact", the SpinButton will appear over NumberBox as a Flyout when NumberBox is in foucs.  <br><br> * If a pre-evaluation expression is stepped, it will be evaluated before the "step" is applied. <br><br> * SpinButton will disable increment/decrement buttons when the limits imposed by Maximum or Minimum would not allow another respective step. <br><br> * If IsWrapEnabled = "true", a step will not stop at the Minium or Maxmum, it will wrap instead. For example, if Minimum="0", Maximum="100", StepFrequency="5", and Value="98", and IsWrapEnabled="True", an incremental step results in Value="3".  |
| Hyper Scroll | * Allows a user to step by scrolling while focused in NumberBox. Align behavior with VS Blend implementation. * Focus and hover required for hyper scroll behavior to take place as to not reduce quality of experience on scrollable surfaces. <br><br> * If a calculation is stepped, it will be calculated before the step is applied. |
| Keyboard Stepping | * Up and Down arrow keys will increment and decrement the Text/Value when NumberBox is in focus. <br><br> * If a calculation is stepped, it will be calculated before the step is applied. |

### Data and Intelligence Metrics
##### P0: Feature Key Performance Indicators

Feature has received enough app/developer validation and feedback for it to exit preview.

* KPI: Three or more first party applications are validating the feature in prerelease.
    * Measurement: Occurrence of NumberBox type in apps on developer devices via telemetry (running under debugger). **Note for telemetry sampling considerations:** Need to be cautious for WinUI as it does not work the same way as with OS SDK. If the solution is not carefully considered, it will result in too little dev data (at 2% sampling) or too much end-user data (at 100% sampling) and hence throttling (telemetry data loss). Requires further investigation. 
    * Measurement: Count of users providing feedback on GitHub/UserVoice/Feedback Hub/SIUF.
    
Developers feel delighted and satisfied with the feature. 

* KPI: Dev NSAT is positive (min), >20 (aspirational) as we exit 2019.
    * Measurement: Developer survey via SIUF, e.g.: "How useful is the feature?"
    
##### P1: Feature Performance Indicators

Calculation support is leveraged by developers + appropriately surfaced to end users. 

* KPI: ~4% of unique instances of NumberBox surface an equation evaluation. 
    * Measurement: Ratio of occurances of NumberBox triggering evaluations compared to total count of NumberBox instances.

## V2 Feature Additions

#### Required

| Feature | Notes |
|:---:|:---|
| Input Validation | <br><br> * Add TextBlockMessage and IconMessage modes to ValidationMode. Both are dependant on WinUI [Input Validation]( https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/blob/user/lucashaines/inputvalidation/active/InputValidation/InputValidation.md) work. <br><br> * If ValidationMode="TextBlockMessage" or ValidationMode="IconMessage", input that is outside the bounds of Minimum/Maximum or non-numerical/formulaic will trigger a validation warning consistent with [Input Validation]( https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/blob/user/lucashaines/inputvalidation/active/InputValidation/InputValidation.md). A Minimum error will display "Minimum is [Minimum]." A Maximum error will display "Maximum is [Maximum]." Input errors will display "Only use numbers and ()+-/* ." Division by zero will return "Division by 0 unsupported." |
| Hyper Drag | * Allows a user to step by focusing on a NumberBox and dragging the cursor while clicking. Align to WinRT XAML Toolkit's NumericUpDown and VS Blend's implementation. <br><br> * If a calculation is stepped, it will be calculated before the step is applied. |
