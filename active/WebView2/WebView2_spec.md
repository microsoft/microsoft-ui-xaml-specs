# Background

This spec describes the WebView2 XAML control, which is the [WinUI 3.0](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/1531) version of the existing [WebView](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.WebView) control. It includes usage of the updated Microsoft Edge browser based on the Chromium web engine.

The API detailed below refers to the middle box is the diagram below. The 'WebView core API' refers to the API covered by the [core Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/hosting/webview2).

# Description

The WebView2 is a control that allows for HTML content to be hosted within an application. It renders web content using the Microsoft Edge (Chromium) rendering engine.

Use a WebView2 control to display richly formatted HTML content from a remote web server, dynamically generated code, or content files in your app. Rich content can also contain script code and communicate between the script and your app's code.

# Examples

## Source:
To set the initial content of the WebView2, set the Source property in XAML. The XAML parser automatically converts the string to a Uri.

```
<!-- Source file is on the web. -->
<WebView2 x:Name="MyWebView_1" UriSource="http://www.contoso.com"/>

<!-- Source file is in local storage. -->
<WebView2 x:Name="MyWebView_2" UriSource="ms-appdata:///local/intro/welcome.html"/>

<!-- Source file is in the app package. -->
<WebView2 x:Name="MyWebView_3" UriSource="ms-appx-web:///help/about.html"/>
```

## Alternative Instantiation Options:
You can also create a WebView with NavigateToString:

```
var myWebView2 = new WebView2();
myWebView2.NavigateToString("<html><body><h2>This is an HTML fragment</h2></body></html>");
```

Or, by providing no URI or content up front:

```
<WebView2 x:Name="MyWebView_4"/>
```

## ExecuteScriptAsync:
You can interact with the content of the WebView2 by using the ExecuteScriptAsync method to invoke or inject script into the WebView2 content, and the WebMessageReceived event to get information back from the WebView2 content.
To invoke JavaScript inside the WebView2 content, use the ExecuteScriptAsync method. ExecuteScriptAsync returns a string which is the object result of the script execution converted to JSON and then returned as a string.

```

// Here, the text of a Xaml TextBox is written to a div in an HTML page hosted in myWebView2.

private async void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    String functionString = String.Format("document.getElementById('nameDiv').innerText = 
    'Hello, {0}';", nameTextBox.Text);
    await myWebView2.ExecuteScriptAsync(functionString);
}

```

## WebMessageReceived:
Scripts in the WebView2 content can use window.chrome.webview.postMessage.postMessage(“Message”) with JSON parameters to send information back to your app. To receive these messages, handle the WebMessageReceived event.


```

myWebView2.WebMessageReceived += (WebView2 sender, WebView2WebMessageReceivedEventArgs args) =>
{
    // Important to validate that the Uri is what we expect from that webview.
    string uriAsString = sender.Source.ToString();

    if (args.Source == uriAsString)
    {
        HandleWebMessageAsString(args.WebMessageAsString);
        HandleWebMessageAsJson(args.WebMessageAsJson);
    }

    else
    {
        // If the source is not validated, don't process the message.
        return;
    }
};
```

## NavigationStarting:
Occurs before the WebView2 navigates to new content. You can cancel navigation in a handler for this event by setting the WebView2NavigationStartingEventArgs.Cancel property to true.


```
myWebView.NavigationStarting += myWebView_NavigationStarting;

private void myWebView_NavigationStarting(WebView2 sender, WebView2NavigationStartingEventArgs args)
{
    if (!IsAllowedUri(args.Uri))
    {
        args.Cancel = true;
    }
}
```

## NavigationCompleted:
Occurs when the WebView2 has finished loading the current content or if the navigation has failed. To determine whether the navigation has failed, check the IsSuccess and WebErrorStatus properties of the WebViewNavigationCompletedEventArgs class.


```
myWebView2.NavigationCompleted += myWebView2_NavigationCompleted;

private void myWebView2_NavigationCompleted(WebView2 sender, WebView2NavigationCompletedEventArgs args)
{
    if (args.IsSuccess)
    {
        statusTextBlock.Text = $"Navigation to {args.Uri} completed successfully.";
    }

    else
    {
        statusTextBlock.Text = $"Navigation to: " + args.Uri.ToString() + " failed with error " + args.WebErrorStatus.ToString("G");
    }
}
```

# API Notes

## Properties:

Source – Gets or sets the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) source of the HTML content to display in the WebView2 control.

CoreWebView2 – Stores the core WebView object with full access to Anaheim WebView API set.

Boolean CanGoBack - Read only property which returns whether calling GoBack() will navigate the webview to the previous page in the navigation history

Boolean CanGoForward - Read only property which returns whether calling GoForward() will navigate the webview to the next page in the navigation history.

## Methods:

void NavigateToString(String htmlContent) – Loads the specified HTML content as a new document.

Windows.Foundation.IAsyncOperation ExecuteScriptAsync(String javascriptCode) –

Executes the specified script from the currently loaded HTML, as an asynchronous action.

void Reload() – Reloads the current content in the WebView2.

void Stop() – Stops the current WebView2 navigation or download.

void GoBack() - Navigates the webview to the previous page in the navigation history.

void GoForward() - Navigates the webview to the next page in the navigation history.

## Events:

WebMessageReceived – Occurs when the content contained in the WebView2 control passes a string to the application by using JavaScipt.

NavigationStarting – Occurs before the WebView2 navigates to new content. You can cancel navigation in a handler for this event by setting the WebViewNavigationStartingEventArgs.Cancel property to true.

ContentLoading - ContentLoading fires when new content has started loading on the webview's main frame or if a same page navigation occurs (such as through fragment navigations or history.pushState navigations). This follows the NavigationStarting event and precedes the NavigationCompleted event.

SourceChanged - Occurs when the 'Source' property is changed

NavigationCompleted – Occurs when the WebView2 has finished loading the current content or if the navigation has failed.

# Remarks

## Migration from Webview -> WebView2
Many users of WebView will be moving from WebView to WebView2. This should be a relatively pain-free process. The goal is to keep as many of the APIs comparable as possible. However, given the change in web engines and architectural impacts a 1:1 parity of APIs will not exist. Some migration notes will emerge as common issues are hit. These will be captured here.

## Core WebView2 Timeline
This API may ship before the WinRT CoreWebView2 object, meaning functionality of the Webview2 would be limited to the APIs included in this document for some interim period of time.
