<!-- The purpose of this spec is to describe a new feature and
its APIs that make up a new feature in WinUI. -->

<!-- There are two audiences for the spec. The first are people
that want to evaluate and give feedback on the API, as part of
the submission process.  When it's complete
it will be incorporated into the public documentation at
docs.microsoft.com (http://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/).
Hopefully we'll be able to copy it mostly verbatim.
So the second audience is everyone that reads there to learn how
and why to use this API. -->

# Background
The proposal for this feature can be found [here.](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/673) The existing API documentation for Grid can be found [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.grid)


Grid is one of the most widely used controls, yet it has a noticeably long and repetitive syntax which leads to a tough learning curve for new developers. Currently, to create a Grid, developers must define each row height and column width on separate lines:
```xml
<Grid>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
          <ColumnDefinition Width="1*" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="2*" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="300" />
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    <Grid.RowDefinitions>
          <RowDefinition Height="1*" />
          <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
          <RowDefinition Height="25" />
          <RowDefinition Height= "14" />
          <RowDefinition Height="20" />
    </Grid.RowDefinitions>
</Grid>
```

This code creates multiple ColumnDefinition objects and RowDefinitions objects and adds them to the Grid's ColumnDefinitions and RowDefinitions collections, respectively. ColumnDefinitions and RowDefinitions are read-only properties of Grid, and the syntax shown above is currently the only way to update these properties. Due to their read-only nature, existing typeconverters cannot be used with these properties. 

The existing syntax supports functionality such as:
- Declaring max/min height or width
```xml
<Grid MaxHeight="600" MaxWidth="600">
  ...
</Grid>
```

- Data binding for row/height values:
```xml
<Grid>
  <Grid.RowDefinitions>
    <RowDefinition Height="{x:Bind sampleDataValue}" />
    ...
  </Grid.RowDefinitions>
</Grid>
```
Grid's usability, intuitiveness, and developer satsifaction will be improved upon by utilizing a more succinct syntax, as will be described throughout this spec. With Grid as the inspiration, other collection-type properties will be able to take advantage of a more succinct syntax as well and see the same benefits.

# Description
<!-- Use this section to provide a brief description of the feature.
For an example, see the introduction to the PasswordBox control 
(http://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/password-box). -->
A new XAML language feature that allows the initialization of collection-type properties (including read-only properties) using element attribute syntax. We will also be assigning properties within Grid to make sure that this syntax works properly specifically for Grid's use cases.

1. When the parser encounters an element attribute that is assigning to a collection-type property, it recognizes that initialization of a collection from a string is being requested. 

2. The parser tokenizes the attribute value (a comma-delimited string) into a series of substrings, each of which represents the initialization value of a single element of the collection.

3. The parser will perform the usual "initialize an instance of a type from a string" operation, using the assigned ContentProperty with the string as an argument to create the object. See Section 6.6.4. Value Creation from Attribute Text in the [MS-XAML Spec](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/a/6/0a6f7755-9af5-448b-907d-13985accf53e/[MS-XAML].pdf) for more details. 

<t/> NOTE: If the property being assigned to already has a value, i.e. its collection already has items in it, the intialized instances will be appended to the existing collection. If the collection is null, a new collection will be created with the initialized items. 

In terms of Grid, this means that the ColumnDefinitions and RowDefinitions properties are able to be defined by providing a comma-delimited string of ColumnDefinitions (Width values) and a comma-delimited string of RowDefinitions (Height values), respectively. 
In order to support this language feature in Grid, a mechanism is needed that allows ColumnDefinition and RowDefinition objects to be createable from their Width/Height properties, respectively. To achieve this, the content property of ColumnDefinition is set to the Width property, and the content property of RowDefinition is set to the Height property.This will be used to make the new syntax (see below) fully functional.


# Examples
### New succinct syntax
The code below has the same functionality as the code shown above with the original syntax. It creates a grid and defines five different rows and columns, each with their own specific height/width, and adds them to the Grid. 
```xml
<Grid ColumnDefinitions="1*, 2*, Auto, *, 300"
      RowDefinitions="1*, Auto, 25, 14, 20">
</Grid>
```

### New succinct syntax for more complex types
The code below shows an example of how the syntax would be used for a collection-typed property that has a different value type. The ColorWheel's Color property is a collection of Color objects, but will be able to be initialized using a comma-separated string with this new language feature, as shown below: 

```xml
<ColorWheel Colors="Red, Green, Blue"/>
```

This shows how String values will be supported, even if they include commas or quotes inside of them. Following standard XML syntax,  you can enclose portions within attribute values (e.g. `hello` in this example) with opposite quotes. So for example if the attribute value uses double quotes, you can use single quotes within the attribute value. The collection shown below has 4 elements, and 'hello, world!' is one element.

```xml
<Bar Words=" 'hello', 'world', 'hello, world!', 'it&apos;s a beautiful day'" />
```

### Grid-specific syntax using assigned ContentProperty 
The code below has the same functionality as the code shown above with the original syntax, but uses the ColumnDefinition and RowDefinition content property assignments to write it in the following way.
```xml
<Grid>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
          <ColumnDefinition>1*</ColumnDefinition>
          <ColumnDefinition>2*</ColumnDefinition>
          <ColumnDefinition>Auto</ColumnDefinition>
          <ColumnDefinition>*</ColumnDefinition>
          <ColumnDefinition>300</ColumnDefinition>
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    <Grid.RowDefinitions>
          <RowDefinition>1*</RowDefinition>
          <RowDefinition>Auto</RowDefinition>
          <RowDefinition>25</RowDefinition>
          <RowDefinition>14</RowDefinition>
          <RowDefinition>20</RowDefinition>
    </Grid.RowDefinitions>
</Grid>
```
<!-- Use this section to explain the features of the API, showing

<!-- Code samples should be in C# and/or C++/WinRT -->

# Remarks
<!-- Explanation and guidance that doesn't fit into the Examples section. -->

<!-- APIs should only throw exceptions in exceptional conditions; basically,
only when there's a bug in the caller, such as argument exception.  But if for some
reason it's necessary for a caller to catch an exception from an API, call that
out with an explanation either here or in the Examples -->
### Syntax Details and Corner Cases
The new succinct syntax is formed by assigning a collection of values to a read-only collection-type property. This collection of values is encased between a set of quotes. String values, as well as any other more complex types that may require commas within it (i.e. Point objects, sets), are encased between a set of opposite quotes. This ensures that string values may contain commas, and Points, sets, or any other kind of nested collection object may be supported.

### Other Use Cases for Succinct Syntax
The succinct syntax was created with the goal of making Grid more intuitive. However, this new syntax will be implemented as a language feature and work properly for any collection-type property. The current syntaxes will still be functional for all other scenarios, as it will be with Grid. Examples of some of these scenarios include, but are not limited to:
#### CalendarView
Current Syntax to populate SelectedDates collection:
```xml
calendarView1.SelectedDates.Add(new DateTime(1977, 1, 5));
calendarView1.SelectedDates.Add(new DateTime(1997, 6, 19));
```
New, equally functional syntax using proposed XAML language feature:
```xml 
<CalendarView SelectedDates="'1/5/1977', '6/19/1997'" />
```

#### ListView
Current Syntax to populate ListView Items collection:
```xml
<ListView>
    <ListView.Items>
        <x:string>Hello</x:string>
        <x:string>World</x:string>
    </ListView.Items>
</ListView>
```
New, equally functional syntax using proposed XAML language feature:
```xml 
<ListView Items="'Hello', 'world'" />
```

### User Error
If a developer uses both syntaxes in their Grid definition, i.e.
```xml
//Warning: Incorrect syntax
<Grid ColumnDefinitions="1*, 2*, Auto, *, 300" RowDefinitions="1*, Auto, 25, 14, 20">
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
          <ColumnDefinition Width="1*" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="2*" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
          <ColumnDefinition Width="300" />
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    <Grid.RowDefinitions>
          <RowDefinition Height="1*" />
          <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
          <RowDefinition Height="25" />
          <RowDefinition Height= "14" />
          <RowDefinition Height="20" />
    </Grid.RowDefinitions>
</Grid>
```
a duplicate property error will be thrown. This is already implemented for read/write properties, but will be implemented for read-only properties such as these as well. 

<!-- Option 1: Give a one or two line description of each API (type
and member), or at least the ones that aren't obvious
from their name.  These descriptions are what show up
in IntelliSense. For properties, specify the default value of the property if it
isn't the type's default (for example an int-typed property that doesn't default to zero.) -->

<!-- Option 2: Put these descriptions in the below API Details section,
with a "///" comment above the member or type. -->

# Appendix
<!-- Anything else that you want to write down for posterity, but 
that isn't necessary to understand the purpose and usage of the API.
For example, implementation details. -->

### Syntax Considerations and Rationale
In developing the syntax, the team considered developer familiarty and patterns as much as possible to ensure that the Grid learning curve could be decreased. One of the considerations was how similar the syntax should be to JSON, as that's a popular notation style that often addresses the same problems that XAML does. 

JSON defines their arrays as: ```"words" : ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]```

XAML defines a collection-typed property as: ```<Words="'Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'"/>```

The syntax that we chose encloses strings individually in quotes, as JSON does, but it does so in a way that is more consistent with existing XAML style and XAML functions. An example of this syntax used elsewhere in XAML is for the x:Bind syntax:

```xml <TextBlock Text="{x:Bind VM.MyText, FallbackValue='Hello, world', Mode=TwoWay}" />```

This uses a comma as a delimiter, but also allows strings to have commas within them. For these reasons, we chose to use the syntax in which a collection can be delimited by commas but have more complex values be encased within single quotes.


### Release Details
The xmlns will not be updated for this XAML language feature addition, i.e. there will be no formal update to the XAML language. Visual Studio, however, will have to be updated to accept the new syntax structure. This feature will be released with WinUI and not with the XAML SDK.

### Tooling/Visual Studio Considerations
The Designer is able to tell when an element is createable from string, and this language feature will make it so all collection-type properties are createable from string (if that string is formatted as a comma-separated list). So, the Designer will recognize that a collection-type property is assigned to a string, check if it is assignable from string, and then attempt to treat the string as a comma-separated list, similar to the way the XAML Parser works. 

For the new syntax to work for Grid specifically, the Designer will not have any extra issues, as it will be able to query for a content property and create the appropriate ColumnDefinition or RowDefinition. 

In terms of usage of this new XAML language feature in Visual Studio, VS needs a way to recognize the current XAML version that the developer is using. This will be likely be done by accessing metadata or accessing an attached features.xml file - the VS team is still in discussion as to which method will be used, but the overall cost is not high.
