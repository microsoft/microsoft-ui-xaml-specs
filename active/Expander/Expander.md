 > This spec corresponds to [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/3279) on the WinUI repo. 

Throughout Windows, different expander controls are used by various apps and surfaces.
Thereâ€™s currently no consistent way to address this common UX pattern.
This control is needed for situations where expanding (instead of overlaying) content is needed.
An Expander control is motivated by its use in many app scenarios and supporting developers in migrating from
[WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/controls/expander-overview?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8)
and [Windows Community Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/controls/expander).  

# API Pages

## Expander class

Represents the control that displays a header and a collapsible content area.

> Spec note: the Expander class and ExpandDirection enum names match WPF.

An Expander control is a UI component that provides a standard interaction for
showing more content in a container that pushes adjacent content while expanding and collapsing.
An Expander cannot be light dismissed and is independent of the contents inside it, including controls.
Expander should be used when some content is only relevant some of the time (for example to
read more information or access additional options for an item). 

![A collapsed Expander that is expanded (pushing downwards) and then collapsed. The Header has the text "This is in the header" and the Content has the text "This is in the content". There is a TextBlock saying "This TextBlock is Below the Expander" that is pushed away](images/Expander_w_textblock.gif)

## Create an Expander

### Examples

#### Create an Expander
![A collapsed Expander that is expanded and then collapsed. The Header has the text "This is in the header" and the Content has the text "This is in the content".](images/DefaultExpander.gif)

XAML
~~~~
<muxc:Expander x:Name="DefaultExpander" 
    Header="Header area"  
    Content="Content area"/>
~~~~

## Put controls inside an Expander
![A collapsed Expander. The Header has a button with the text "This ToggleButton is in the Header" and the Content has a button with the text "This ToggleButton is in the Content". The button in the Header is toggled on and off, the Expander is expanded, the button in the Content is toggled on and off, and the Expander is collapsed.](images/Expander_w_togglebuttons.gif)

XAML
~~~~
<muxc:Expander x:Name="Expander2" Header="This is in the header"> 
    <muxc:Expander.Header>
        <ToggleButton>This ToggleButton is in the Header</ToggleButton>
    </muxc:Expander.Header>
    <muxc:Expander.Content>
        <ToggleButton>This ToggleButton is in the Content</ToggleButton>
    </muxc:Expander.Content>
</muxc:Expander>

### Theme Resources

You can modify the look of an Expander by specifying Xaml resources in your app.
For more info, see the
[lightweight styling guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/xaml-styles#lightweight-styling).

| Name| Description | 
| :---------- | :------- | 
| ExpanderChevronMargin | Chevron margin thickness| 
| ExpanderChevronGlyph | Chevron glyph| 
| ExpanderChevronSize | Chevron size|
| ExpanderPopinVerticalOffset | vertical offset for animation| 

Some theme resources TBD.



## Expander members

### Properties

| Name | Description | Default |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- |
| Header | Gets or sets the content of the Header area | null | 
| ExpandDirection | Gets or sets the direction of expansion | Down = 0 |
| IsExpanded | Gets or sets whether or not control is expanded | False |
| HeaderTemplate | Gets or sets the DataTemplate to display the content of the control's header | null |
| HeaderTemplateSelector | Gets or Sets the DataTemplateSelector that enables custom template selection logic at the application level. | N/A |


### Events
| Name | Description | 
| :---------- | :------- | 
| Expanding | Occurs when expanding |
| Collapsed| Occurs when collapsing |

| Name| Description | Type |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- | 
| ExpanderChevronMargin | Sets the margin thickness for the chevron | Thickness |
| ExpanderChevronUpGlyph | Sets the default chevron glyph for ExpandDirection = Up | String | 
| ExpanderChevronDownGlyph | Sets the default chevron glyph for ExpandDirection = Down | String |
| ExpanderChevronSize | Sets the size of the chevron glyph | Double |
| ExpanderCornerRadius | Sets the corner radius in pixels | CornerRadius |
| ExpanderPopinVerticalOffset | Sets the vertical offset for animation | Double |
| ExpanderMinHeight | Sets the minimum height | Double |
| ExpanderPadding | Sets the padding thickness for Expander | Thickness |
| ExpanderHeaderPadding | Sets the padding thickness for the Header | Thickness |

### Under Discussion
The below properties are under discussion for how properties should propagate to Expander's Header and/or Content area.
| Name| Description | Type |
| :---------- | :------- | :------- | 
| Background | (currently) Sets the background color for the Header | Brush |

| FontFamily | (currently) Sets the font family for the Content | Double |

#### Example showing these properties:
![An Expander where the entire header area (including 'under' the chevron) is Cyan, with default text styling, but the content area has default background color with text that is pink and size 25 Times New Roman font.](images/Expander_property_inheritance.png)

XAML
~~~~
<muxc:Expander x:Name="ExpanderWithStyleProperties" 
    Header="This is in the header"  
    Content="This is in the content" 
    Background="Cyan"/>
    Foreground="Magenta" 
    FontSize ="25" 
    FontFamily="Times New Roman"

# Inputs and Accessibility

## UI Automation Patterns
Expander will use a ExpandCollapsePattern. Expanding/Collapsing the expander will raise [RaisePropertyChanged](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.automation.peers.automationpeer.raisepropertychangedevent) with the property changed being the [ExpandCollapseProperty](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.automation.expandcollapsepatternidentifiers.expandcollapsestateproperty) property.

## Keyboard
* Tabbing brings focus to the Header, neither the entire Expander nor the chevron is a tab-stop
* After the Header is focused, any focusable content inside the Header is focused 
* When focus is on the Header, space key expands and collapse and focus does not move
* Keyboard navigation inside the Expander's Header/Content is based on the content inside them

## GamePad
The Expander can be expanded and collapsed with the A button. Spatial navigation will navigate between the content of the Expander. 

## Screen reader
When focus is on the Header of an Expander, the screen reader will announce the contents of the Header, then announce "Expander collapsed" or "Expander expanded". With focus staying on the header, the screen reader will then anounce "expanded" or "collapsed" accordingly. Within the Header or Content areas the screen reader will announce the content a developers has put inside. Expander should not have [focus engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/gamepad-and-remote-interactions#focus-engagement) enabled. 

# Appendix
<!-- Anything else that you want to write down for posterity, but 
that isn't necessary to understand the purpose and usage of the API.
For example, implementation details. --> 

# Open Questions
* How should properties from ContentControl (ex: Background, Foreground, FontSize) propagate?
* Should ExpandDirection actually be ExpanderExpandingDirection?
* Should Content default to HorizontalAlignment = Left? (See [discussion from XCG PR](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/OS/_workitems/edit/28578487))
